This web application is created using create-react-app

1. I fetched the data using Fetch API

2. I add a button in the navbar saying 'Get Users', which makes an API call. I solve this problem using a state. the state will be false first. then on the button click the state will be true. So i set a condition that if the state true then fetch the data other wise not.

3. I showed a loader while fetching the data. I use a state. before fetching state will be true and after successfully done the fetching the state will be false. then I set a condition if state is true then show a loader otherwise not.

4. I styled the application using custom CSS and styled-component.
